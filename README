libdebctrl: A library for manipulating Debian Control files

*** WARNING ***

Note that this API is new and constantly changing. Both the API and ABI are
set to change, possibly even significantly, as the project progresses. It is
by no means a stable interface, so do not rely on its current state; due to
the complex nature of some of the features in the roadmap, this release should
be considered a PREVIEW RELEASE to give a general idea of what can be done
with such a library.

---

libdebctrl is a C library for working with (parsing, manipulating, writing)
Debian Control files. It processes control files in two phases:

 1. Parsing syntax of RFC-822 alike files, with Debian-specific extensions
 2. Semantic parsing and basic validation of data

Currently, it supports parsing <debian/control> files. Since Step 1 is very
generalized, it is planned for use in parsing similarly formatted files, such
as *.changes and <debian/copyright> files.

To compile the C library (as a shared .so library and a statically linked
.a collection of objects) and all accompanying documentation, simply:

  $ make
  $ sudo make install

in the root directory of this package.

Once installed on your system (by default in /usr/local), you can build
and play with the example 'display' program, which simply reads in control
data (from a debian/control file) and displays it on-screen. With this,
you can get a feel for how the library works and what it might be useful
for. Building examples is as easy as:

  $ make -C examples/

from the root directory. Note that there is no install target, since the
examples aren't meant to be installed on your system.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This library was made possible by contributions from countless others in the
Open Source community. Without their continued effort, talent and generosity,
this project could not exist in its current form. We all stand on shoulders of
giants.

Here are some nice things to live by:

 1. Give credit where it's due.
 2. Share your modifications, so everyone benefits from them.
 3. Do something nice for the authors.
 4. Help someone who needs it.
 5. Don't waste. Anything. Be especially careful not to waste energy that
    comes from non-renewable sources.
 6. Be tolerant. Everything that's good in nature comes from cooperation.

library build structure came from his libjio project.
